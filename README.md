# Smart-Parking-Database-Managment-System

We have created a database managment system for smart parking lots consisting of features like ANPR(Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras and RFID based automatic entry and various modes of payment at the time of exit.

**Steps to run queries and test the database**
1.	Run “Final_db.sql” in “MySQL Workbench” to create schema and tables along with data preinserted.
2.	Open query files from “Queries/SQL_files” to run queries on that database.
3.	“Queries/Output photots” contains snapshots of the output of SQL queries.
4.	“Tables_csv” contains CSV files of data of all SQL tables.
5.	“Entries_data” contains information about number of rows and columns in each table and total number of entries in the database.
